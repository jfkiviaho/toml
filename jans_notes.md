* Read through Tingwei's presentation slides
* Skimmed papers and changed titles
* Started literature review table on Google Sheets
* Started grabbing BibTex citation information

Many papers pick convolutional neural networks.
That seems like the obvious choice in architecture.
What about graph neural networks?
Could they help put the topology in topology optimization?

Questions to think about during literature review:

* What is the point of topology optimization?
* What are the challenges in topology optimization?
* What can machine learning techniques do for topology optimization?
* Which challenges, e.g. parameterization of topology, accelerating analysis, can they address?
* What are the recurring themes, i.e. convolutional neural networks, that you observe in this research at the intersection of machine learning and topology optimization?

* Found and read through a new deal.II tutorial on topology optimization of elastic media
* Started GitHub repository for paper and, eventually, our experiments and results
* Started collecting BibTex citations
